# Squares
A simple 2D android game made using GameMaker Studios. The objective of the game is to tap on the falling squares before they hit the ground. Open the .gmx file inside GameMaker Studios to edit the game. Game files and the .apk of the game is include in the repo.

Sadly, this game is still in alpha (but it's mostly stable and should run on most devices) but I've no intentions of updating or patching this game since I've moved on to other projects.
